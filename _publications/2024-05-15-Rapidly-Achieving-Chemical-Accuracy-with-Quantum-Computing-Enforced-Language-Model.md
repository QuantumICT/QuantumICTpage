Finding accurate ground state energy of a many-body system has been a major challenge in quantum chemistry. The integration of classic and quantum computers has shed new light on resolving this outstanding problem. Here we propose QiankunNet-VQE, a transformer based language models enforced with quantum computing to learn and generate quantum states. It has been implemented using up to 12 qubits and attaining an accuracy level competitive with state-of-the-art classical methods. By leveraging both quantum and classical resources, this scheme overcomes the limitations of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) without the need for cumbersome error mitigation. Moreover, QiankunNet-VQE provides a different route to achieve a practical quantum advantage for solving many-electron Schrödinger equation without requiring extremely precise preparation and measurement of the ground-state wavefunction on quantum computer. © 2024, CC BY.
