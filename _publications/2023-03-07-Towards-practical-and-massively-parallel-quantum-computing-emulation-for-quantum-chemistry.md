Quantum computing is moving beyond its early stage and seeking for commercial applications in chemical and biomedical sciences. In the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era, quantum resource is too scarce to support these explorations. Therefore, it is valuable to emulate quantum computing on classical computers for developing quantum algorithms and validating quantum hardware. However, existing simulators mostly suffer from the memory bottleneck so developing the approaches for large-scale quantum chemistry calculations remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a high-performance and massively parallel variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulator based on matrix product states, combined with embedding theory for solving large-scale quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry on HPC platforms. We apply this method to study the torsional barrier of ethane and the quantification of the protein-ligand interactions. Our largest simulation reaches 1000 qubits, and a performance of 216.9 PFLOPS is achieved on a new Sunway supercomputer, which sets the state-of-the-art for quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry.
