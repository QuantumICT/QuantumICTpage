 abstract = {Neural network methods have shown promise for solving complex quantum many-body systems. In this study, we develop a novel approach through incorporating the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with the neural network quantum state method. The results demonstrate that, when tensor-network pre-training is introduced into the neural network, a high efficiency can be achieved for quantum many-body systems with strong correlations.},
