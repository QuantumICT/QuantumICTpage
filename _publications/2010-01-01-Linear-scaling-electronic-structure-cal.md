 abstract = {We discuss in this review recent progress, especially by our group,$\backslash$non linear scaling algorithms for electronic structure calculations$\backslash$nwith numerical atomic basis sets. The principles of the construction$\backslash$nof numerical basis sets and the Hamiltonian are introduced first.$\backslash$nThen we discuss how to solve the single-electron equation self-consistently,$\backslash$nand how to obtain electronic properties via post-self-consistent-field$\backslash$nprocesses in a linear scaling way. The linear response calculation$\backslash$nwith linear scaling is also introduced. Numerical implementation$\backslash$nis emphasized, with some applications presented for demonstration$\backslash$npurposes.},
