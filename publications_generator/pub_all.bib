abstract = {High performance computing (HPC) is renowned for its capacity to tackle complex problems. Meanwhile{,} quantum computing (QC) provides a potential way to accurately and efficiently solve quantum chemistry problems. The emerging field of quantum-centric high performance computing (QCHPC){,} which merges these two powerful technologies{,} is anticipated to enhance computational capabilities for solving challenging problems in quantum chemistry. The implementation of QCHPC for quantum chemistry requires interdisciplinary research and collaboration across multiple fields{,} including quantum chemistry{,} quantum physics{,} computer science and so on. This perspective provides an introduction to the quantum algorithms that are suitable for deployment in QCHPC{,} focusing on conceptual insights rather than technical details. Parallel strategies to implement these algorithms on quantum-centric supercomputers are discussed. We also summarize high performance quantum emulating simulators{,} which are considered a viable tool to explore QCHPC. We conclude with challenges and outlooks in this field.},

abstract = {Quantum Computing is believed to be the ultimate solution for quantum chemistry problems. Before the advent of large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising heuristic quantum algorithm to solve real world quantum chemistry problems on near-term noisy quantum computers. Here we propose a highly parallelizable classical simulator for VQE based on the matrix product state representation of quantum state, which significantly extend the simulation range of the existing simulators. Our simulator seamlessly integrates the quantum circuit evolution into the classical auto-differentiation framework, thus the gradients could be computed efficiently similar to the classical deep neural network, with a scaling that is independent of the number of variational parameters. As applications, we use our simulator to study commonly used small molecules such as HF, HCl, LiH and H 2 O, as well as larger molecules CO 2 , BeH 2 and H 4 with up to 40 qubits. The favorable scaling of our simulator against the number of qubits and the number of parameters could make it an ideal testing ground for near-term quantum algorithms and a perfect benchmarking baseline for oncoming large scale VQE experiments on noisy quantum computers.},

abstract = {Quantum computing is attracting more and more attention in material and biological science. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing era, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is expected as an effective method to solve quantum chemistry problems which has potential quantum advantage. Classically simulating quantum algorithms plays a critical role in algorithmic development and the validation of noisy quantum devices before large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers are developed. However, most existing simulators are based on the state vector or density matrix representation of the quantum state which is faced with the memory bottleneck due to the exponential growth of memory requirement as the number of qubits increases. In this work, we present a VQE simulator based on the matrix product states (MPS) method from quantum many-body physics, and a detailed study of our MPS-VQE simulator in quantum chemistry applications. The memory requirement of MPS-VQE grows only polynomially and we demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained despite the truncation of the smallest singular values during the algorithm. A distributed parallelization scheme is also presented for massively parallel computer systems, and different implementations of the parallelization scheme based on the Julia language are benchmarked which demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our method. Our method could open a new avenue towards large-scale classical simulation of quantum computational chemistry.}

@article{Qin2023,
abstract = {The NAO2GTO scheme provides an efficient way to evaluate the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) over numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs) with auxiliary Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs). However, the NAO2GTO fitting will significantly impact the accuracy and convergence of hybrid functional calculations. To address this issue, here we propose to use the fitted orbitals as a new numerical basis to properly handle the mismatch between NAOs and fitted GTOs. We present an efficient and linear-scaling implementation of analytical gradients of Hartree-Fock exchange (HFX) energy for periodic HSE06 calculations with fitted NAOs in the HONPAS package. In our implementation, the ERIs and their derivatives for HFX matrix and forces are evaluated analytically with the auxiliary GTOs, while other terms are calculated using numerically discretized GTOs. Several integral screening techniques are employed to reduce the number of required ERI derivatives. We benchmark the accuracy and efficiency of our implementation and demonstrate that our results of lattice constants, bulk moduli, and band gaps of several typical semiconductors are in good agreement with the experimental values. We also show that the calculation of HFX forces based on a master-worker dynamic parallel scheme has a very high efficiency and scales linearly with respect to system size. Finally, we study the geometry optimization and polaron formation due to an excess electron in rutile TiO 2 by means of HSE06 calculations to further validate the applicability of our implementation.},

In the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era, the quantum resource is too scarce to support these explorations. Therefore, it is valuable to emulate quantum computing on classical computers for developing quantum algorithms and validating quantum hardware. However, existing simulators mostly suffer from the memory bottleneck so developing the approaches for large-scale quantum chemistry calculations remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a high-performance and massively parallel variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulator based on matrix product states, combined with embedding theory for solving large-scale quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry on HPC platforms. We apply this method to study the torsional barrier of ethane and the quantification of the protein–ligand interactions.

@article{Tahir2022,
abstract = {We develop and implement a formalism which enables calculating the analytical gradients of particle-hole random-phase approximation (RPA) ground-state energy with respect to the atomic positions within the atomic orbital basis set framework. Our approach is based on a localized resolution of identity (LRI) approximation for evaluating the two-electron Coulomb integrals and their derivatives, and the density functional perturbation theory for computing the first-order derivatives of the Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals and orbital energies. Our implementation allows one to relax molecular structures at the RPA level using both Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) and numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs). Benchmark calculations against previous implementations show that our approach delivers adequate numerical precision, highlighting the usefulness of LRI in the context of RPA gradient evaluations. A careful assessment of the quality of RPA geometries for small molecules reveals that post-KS RPA systematically overestimates the bond lengths. We furthermore optimized the geometries of the four low-lying water hexamers-cage, prism, cyclic, and book isomers, and determined the energy hierarchy of these four isomers using RPA. The obtained RPA energy ordering is in good agreement with that yielded by the coupled cluster method with single, double and perturbative triple excitations, despite that the dissociation energies themselves are appreciably underestimated. The underestimation of the dissociation energies by RPA is well corrected by the renormalized single excitation correction.},

The major innovations include: (1) a Matrix Product State (MPS) based VQE simulator to reduce the amount of memory needed and increase the simulation efficiency; (2) a combination of the Density Matrix Embedding Theory with the MPS-based VQE simulator to further extend the simulation range; (3) A three-level parallelization scheme to scale up to 20 million cores; (4) Usage of the Julia script language as the main programming language, which both makes the programming easier and enables cutting edge performance as native C or Fortran; (5) Study of real chemistry systems based on the VQE simulator, achieving nearly linearly strong and weak scaling. Our simulation demonstrates the power of VQE for large quantum chemistry systems, thus paves the way for large-scale VQE experiments on near-term quantum computers.},

abstract = {The Poisson solver for the calculation of the electrostatic potential is an essential primitive in quantum mechanics calculations. In this article, we adopt the Ewald method and propose a highly-optimized and scalable framework for Poisson solver, MMEwald, on the new generation Sunway supercomputer, capable of utilizing the collection of 390-core accelerators it uses. The MMEwald is based on a grid adapted cut-plane approach to partition the points into batches and distribute the batch to the processors. Furthermore, we propose a set of architecture-specific optimizations to efficiently utilize the memory bandwidth and computation capacity of the supercomputer. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the MMEwald in providing strong and weak scaling performance.},

abstract = {Raman spectroscopy provides chemical and compositional information that can serve as a structural fingerprint for various materials. Therefore, simulations of Raman spectra, including both quantum perturbation analyses and ground-state calculations, are of significant interest. However, highly accurate full quantum mechanical (QM) simulations of Raman spectra have previously been confined to small systems. For large systems such as biological materials, full QM simulations have an extremely high computational cost and remain challenging. In this work, robust new algorithms and advanced implementations on many-core architectures are employed to enable fast, accurate, and massively parallel full ab initio simulations of the Raman spectra of realistic biological systems containing up to 3006 atoms, with excellent strong and weak scaling. Up to a performance of 468.5 PFLOP/s in double-precision and 813.7 PLOPS/s in mixed-half precision is achieved on the new-generation Sunway high-performance computing system, suggesting the potential for new applications of the QM approach to biological systems.},

abstract = {Vacancy and its clusters are among the most important defects induced by self-irradiation in plutonium-gallium (Pu-Ga) alloys. For decades-long stockpiles, the generation and evolution of vacancy defects could cause void swelling and helium bubble formation, resulting in the ageing of the Pu-Ga alloys. Therefore, to shed light on the ageing mechanisms caused by vacancies in Pu-Ga alloys, the long-term behaviour of vacancy defects in Pu-Ga alloys is simulated employing an AKMC model parameterized by molecular statics calculations. By tracking the number of vacancy defects, the size distribution of vacancy clusters, and the largest vacancy clusters over time, we found that temperature and Ga concentration significantly influence the evolution of vacancy defects in Pu-Ga alloys. Temperature changes could affect the clustering behaviour of mono vacancies, and critical temperatures initializing the nucleation of vacancy clusters are observed. On the other hand, adding Ga contents in Pu-Ga alloys could increase the migration energy of and attractive interaction among vacancies, leading to increased vacancy cluster numbers at high temperatures.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) non-van der Waals magnetic materials have attracted considerable attention due to their high-temperature ferromagnetism, active surface/interface properties originating from dangling bonds, and good stability under ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate the controlled synthesis and systematic Raman investigation of ultrathin non-van der Waals antiferromagnetic $\alpha$-MnSe single crystals. Square and triangular nanosheets with different growth orientations can be achieved by introducing different precursors via the atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) method. The temperature-dependent resonant enhancement in the Raman intensity of two peaks at 233.8 cm-1 and 459.9 cm-1 gives obvious evidence that the antiferromagnetic spin-ordering is below TN ∼ 160 K. Besides, a new peak located at 254.2 cm-1, gradually appearing as the temperature decreased from 180 K to 100 K, may also be a signature of phase transition from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic. The phonon dispersion spectra of $\alpha$-MnSe simulated by density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) match well with the observed Raman signals. Moreover, a fabricated $\alpha$-MnSe phototransistor exhibits p-type conducting behavior and high photodetection performance. We believe that these findings will be beneficial for the applications of 2D $\alpha$-MnSe in magnetic and semiconducting fields.},

abstract = {Since the interaction between electrons and atomic nuclei can affect the electronic structure, in recent years, first-principles-based electron-phonon renormalization methods have been applied in the condensed matter physics community to account for the influence of the electron-phonon coupling in solid systems. However, little is yet known about the behavior and trends of the electron-phonon renormalization in the molecules. In this work, the method for the electron-phonon renormalization in molecules has been derived, using which, we exhaustively investigate the zero-point renormalization in 32 molecules with three different density functions. We find that the renormalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap due to electron-vibration coupling does not relate to the atomic masses but quite relates to the electronic structure properties of the molecules.},

abstract = {Electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction plays an important role in addressing the renormalization of the electronic structure properties. Even at 0 K, such e-ph renormalization still exists because of the zero-point motion of the nuclei, which is known as zero-point renormalization (ZPR). Cardona and Thewalt have found that, for monoatomic materials, the ZPR should be proportional to the inverse square root of the atomic mass. In order to thoughtfully examine the mass factor with the accurate all-electron first-principles approach, we calculate the ZPR of the electronic structure for 82 octet binary materials in both the zincblende and the rocksalt structures. We found that only considering the mass factor is not enough for the ZPR, especially for the investigated polar materials. Besides the mass factor, the lattice geometry, the electronic band structure properties, and the long-range polar corrections are also need to be considered.},

Here for the response properties with respect to the homogeneous electric field, we present an efficient parallel linear scaling algorithm for the response density matrix calculation. Our scheme is based on the second-order trace-correcting purification and the parallel sparse matrix–matrix multiplication algorithms. The new scheme reduces the formal scaling from O(N3) to O(N), and shows good parallel scalability over tens of thousands of cores. As demonstrated by extensive validation, we achieve a rapid computation of accurate polarizabilities using DFPT. Finally, the computational efficiency of this scheme has been illustrated by making the scaling tests and scalability tests on massively parallel computer systems.}

abstract = {Hybrid density-functional calculation is one of the most commonly adopted electronic structure theories in computational chemistry and materials science because of its balance between accuracy and computational cost. Recently, we have developed a novel scheme called NAO2GTO to achieve linear scaling (Order-N) calculations for hybrid density-functionals. In our scheme, the most time-consuming step is the calculation of the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) part, so creating an even distribution of these ERIs in parallel implementation is an issue of particular importance. Here, we present two static scalable distributed algorithms for the ERIs computation. Firstly, the ERIs are distributed over ERIs shell pairs. Secondly, the ERIs are distributed over ERIs shell quartets. In both algorithms, the calculation of ERIs is independent of each other, so the communication time is minimized. We show our speedup results to demonstrate the performance of these static parallel distributed algorithms in the Hefei Order-N packages for ab initio simulations.},

@article{Simon2017,
abstract = {Abstract The role of Li in Li/MgO as a catalyst for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is to promote MgO surface morphology change rather than serve as a constituent of catalytically active sites. While Li/MgO is unstable at realistic conditions with respect to loss of Li, the resulting samples show enhanced selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons versus CO2, although activity is low and close to pristine MgO. The way (co-)doping with alio-valent metal ions affects the catalytic performance of Li/MgO has now been explored. To analyze the structure and the stability of the samples, catalysts with well-defined stoichiometry were prepared using a co-precipitation method with freeze-drying and subsequent annealing. Gd and Fe were used as dopants. Apart from their potential direct role in catalysis, these dopants are anticipated to stabilize Li in the catalyst under the reaction conditions, allowing further clarification of the role of Li. In the case of Gd/Li co-doping, changes observed in EPR and 7Li-NMR spectra indicate the formation of correlated, next-neighbor Li?Mg???Gd+Mg pairs co-existing with ��isolated�� Gd3+ ions at octahedral Mg lattice sites. For Li/Fe co-doping, no significant change in the EPR pattern is observed in the presence of Li+ ions, indicating a larger distance between the Li+ and Fe3+ cations in the MgO lattice. Hybrid DFT calculations explain the difference between Fe and Gd co-doping by a less efficient screening of the Coulomb repulsion between Gd3+ and neighboring cations in Gd doped samples, leading to the stabilization of LiMg near GdMg.},

@article{Sezen2015,
abstract = {Despite their pronounced importance for oxide-based photochemistry, optoelectronics and photovoltaics, only fairly little is known about the polaron lifetimes and binding energies. Polarons represent a crucial intermediate step populated immediately after dissociation of the excitons formed in the primary photoabsorption process. Here we present a novel approach to studying photoexcited polarons in an important photoactive oxide, ZnO, using infrared (IR) reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) with a time resolution of 100 ms. For well-defined (10-10) oriented ZnO single-crystal substrates, we observe intense IR absorption bands at around 200 meV exhibiting a pronounced temperature dependence. On the basis of first-principles-based electronic structure calculations, we assign these features to hole polarons of intermediate coupling strength.},

NAOs of valence electrons are fitted with gaussian-type orbitals, which is convenient for the calculation of electron repulsion integrals and the construction of Hartree-Fock exchange matrix elements. All other parts of Hamiltonian matrix elements are constructed directly with NAOs. The strict locality of NAOs is adopted as an efficient two-electron integral screening technique to speed up calculations.},
