The more efficient RPA force calculations allow us to relax structures of medium-size water clusters. Particular attention is paid to the structures and energy orderings of the low-energy isomers of (H2O)n clusters with n = 21, 22, and 25. It is found that the energy ordering of the low-energy isomers of these water clusters are rather sensitive to how their structures are determined. For the five low-energy isomers of (H2O)25, the RPA energy ordering based on the RPA geometries is quite different from that based on the geometries relaxed by lower-level theories, in contrast with the situation of small water clusters like the water hexamer. The standard RPA underbinds the water clusters, and this underbinding behavior gets more pronounced as the complete basis set (CBS) limit is approached. The renormalized single excitation (rSE) correction remedies this underbinding, giving rise to a noticeable overbinding behavior at finite basis sets. However, as the CBS limit is approached, RPA+rSE yields an accuracy for the binding energies that is comparable to the best available double hybrid functionals, as demonstrated for the WATER27 testset. © 2024, CC BY.",68,Binding energy,Approximation algorithms - Electric circuit breakers - Isomers - Quantum chemistry,Analytical gradients - Complete basis set limit - Electron correlation energy - Energy orderings - Energy-based - Lowest-energy isomers - Random phase approximations - Relaxation-based - Single excitation - Water cluster,801.4 Physical Chemistry - 804 Chemical Products Generally - 921 Mathematics,,,,Compendex,"Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Engineering Village,,,,

In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing era, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is expected as an effective method to solve quantum chemistry problems which has potential quantum advantage. Classically simulating quantum algorithms plays a critical role in algorithmic development and the validation of noisy quantum devices before large-scale, fully fault-tolerant quantum computers are developed. However, most existing simulators are based on the state vector or density matrix representation of the quantum state which is faced with the memory bottleneck due to the exponential growth of memory requirement as the number of qubits increases. In this work, we present a VQE simulator based on the matrix product states (MPS) method from quantum many-body physics, and a detailed study of our MPS-VQE simulator in quantum chemistry applications. The memory requirement of MPS-VQE grows only polynomially and we demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained despite the truncation of the smallest singular values during the algorithm. A distributed parallelization scheme is also presented for massively parallel computer systems, and different implementations of the parallelization scheme based on the Julia language are benchmarked which demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our method.

The origin of their broadband emission has been commonly attributed to self-trapped excitons (STEs) composed of localized electronic polarization with a distorted lattice. Unfortunately, the exact electronic and structural nature of the STE species in these WLE materials remains elusive, hindering the rational design of high-efficiency WLE materials. In this study, by combining ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we uncover surprisingly similar STE features in two prototypical low dimensional WLE perovskite single crystals: 1D (DMEDA)PbBr4 and 2D (EDBE)PbBr4, despite of their different dimensionalities. Photoexcited excitons rapidly localize to intrinsic STEs within ∼250 fs, contributing to the white light emission. Crucially, STEs in both systems exhibit characteristic absorption features akin to those of Pb+ and Pb3+. Further atomic level theoretical simulations confirm photoexcited electrons and holes are localized on the Pb2+ site to form Pb+- and Pb3+-like species, resembling transient photoinduced Pb2+ disproportionation.

However, systematic theoretical Raman analysis for 2D materials remains scarce. Ytterbium oxychloride (YbOCl) is a recently discovered 2D material that belongs to the MYX (M = transition metals; Y = O, S, Se, etc.; X = halogen) family. It exhibits half-metallic ferromagnetism, which makes it a promising candidate for spintronic devices in the future. Taking YbOCl as an example, we explored the key determinants in the calculation of the Raman spectrum. The assessment of potential-energy surfaces (PES) determined by different exchange-correlation functionals (xc-functionals) and van der Waals (vdW) corrections was found to be crucial for harmonic Raman simulation. Then, the anharmonic effects of this material resulting from electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions were analyzed by using the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) method and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and these results indicate that the anharmonic effect is weak in the YbOCl crystal. Finally, temperature- and strain-dependent Raman spectra confirmed that the vdW interactions in the YbOCl crystal are considerably weaker than the chemical bonding interactions; this tenuous interlayer vdW interaction was further substantiated via Raman simulations encompassing distinct layers. Such theoretical approaches to scrutinizing the Raman spectrum furnish invaluable insights into the intrinsic structural information and interactions of materials. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",87,Raman scattering,Chemical bonds - Chlorine compounds - Density functional theory - Molecular dynamics - Potential energy - Quantum chemistry - Spectrum analysis - Transition metals - Van der Waals forces - Ytterbium compounds,Anharmonic effect - First principles - Interaction information - Material interactions - Materials structure - Oxychlorides - Principle analysis - Structure information - Two-dimensional - Van Der Waals interactions,531 Metallurgy and Metallography - 741.1 Light/Optics - 801.4 Physical Chemistry - 922.1 Probability Theory - 931.3 Atomic and Molecular Physics - 931.4 Quantum Theory; Quantum Mechanics,"Number: 21825302,22003073,T2222026, Acronym: NSFC, Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Number: XDB0450101, Acronym: CAS, Sponsor: Chinese Academy of Sciences; Number: -, Acronym: USTC, Sponsor: University of Science and Technology of China; ","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos.

However, their solar cell efficiencies are strongly hampered by anomalously large voltage loss (>0.6 V), whose origin remains controversial so far. Herein, by combining ultrafast pump–probe spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the coupled electronic and structural dynamics leading to excited state self-trapping in antimony chalcogenides with atomic level characterizations is reported. The electronic dynamics in Sb2Se3 indicates a ≈20 ps barrierless intrinsic self-trapping, with electron localization and accompanied lattice distortion given by DFT calculations. Furthermore, impulsive vibrational coherences unveil key Sb-Se vibrational modes and their real-time interplay that drive initial excited state relaxation and energy dissipation toward stabilized small polaron through electron–phonon and subsequent phonon–phonon coupling. This study's findings provide conclusive evidence of carrier self-trapping arising from intrinsic lattice anharmonicity and polaronic effect in antimony chalcogenides and a new understanding on the coupled electronic and structural dynamics for redefining excited state properties in soft semiconductor materials. © 2022 The Authors.

In this work, the method for the electron-phonon renormalization in molecules has been derived, using which, we exhaustively investigate the zero-point renormalization in 32 molecules with three different density functions.

Based on the AKMC (atomic kinetic Monte Carlo) method, the effect of alloy element Mn on the formation of Cu-enriched clusters during thermal ageing in the Fe-1.34at.%Cu-Xat.%Mn (X is 0, 0.27, 1.2, 3, and 5) alloy was studied. The research results show that with the increase of Mn content in the alloy, the number density of nano-scale Cu-enriched clusters continues to increase, and Mn content has little effect on the average size of Cu-enriched clusters. The cluster is enriched in Cu, and the Mn content in the cluster increases with the Mn content in the matrix. The percentage of alloy elements involved in the formation of clusters determines the average cluster size. The higher diffusion ability and longer diffusion distance of the Cu-Vac complex are the main factors that cause the precipitation of Cu-enriched clusters, and the addition of Mn will inhibit the diffusion mobility of the Cu-Vac complex, thereby increasing the number density of the cluster. The addition of alloy element Mn will affect the size and number density of Cu-enriched clusters, thereby affecting the hardening effect caused by Cu-enriched clusters. © 2021, Editorial Board of Atomic Energy Science and Technology.

Square and triangular nanosheets with different growth orientations can be achieved by introducing different precursors via the atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) method. The temperature-dependent resonant enhancement in the Raman intensity of two peaks at 233.8 cm-1 and 459.9 cm-1 gives obvious evidence that the antiferromagnetic spin-ordering is below TN ∼ 160 K. Besides, a new peak located at 254.2 cm-1, gradually appearing as the temperature decreased from 180 K to 100 K, may also be a signature of phase transition from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic.

Our approach is based on a localized resolution of identity (LRI) approximation for evaluating the two-electron Coulomb integrals and their derivatives, and the density functional perturbation theory for computing the first-order derivatives of the Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals and orbital energies. Our implementation allows one to relax molecular structures at the RPA level using both Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) and numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs). Benchmark calculations show that our approach delivers high numerical precision compared to previous implementations. A careful assessment of the quality of RPA geometries for small molecules reveals that post-KS RPA systematically overestimates the bond lengths. We furthermore optimized the geometries of the four low-lying water hexamers – cage, prism, cyclic and book isomers, and determined the energy hierarchy of these four isomers using RPA. The obtained RPA energy ordering is in good agreement with that yielded by the coupled cluster method with single, double and perturbative triple excitations, despite that the dissociation energies themselves are appreciably underestimated.

We propose a minimize-memory contraction path algorithm for rectangular quantum grids to reduce the memory overhead, and provide the memory-limited simulation capacity of SW26010pro. Moreover, tensor operations are carefully optimized on the SW processor to achieve high performance. We design a fault tolerance mechanism to improve the extreme-scale parallel stability.We benchmark SW-Qsim s simulation of RQCs up to 400-qubits, achieving near-linear strong and weak scaling with up to 28.75 million cores, far beyond the previous state of the art.

As demonstrated by extensive validation, we achieve a rapid computation of accurate response properties of molecules and solids. As an application showcase, we present harmonic and anharmonic Raman spectra, the latter obtained by combining hundreds of thousands of PT calculations with ab initio molecular dynamics.

Further analysis reveals that predominantly diagonal force constant terms are affected, which can be bypassed efficiently by invoking translational symmetry. Copyright © 2017, The Authors.

While Li/MgO is unstable at realistic conditions with respect to loss of Li, the resulting samples show enhanced selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons versus CO2, although activity is low and close to pristine MgO. The way (co-)doping with alio-valent metal ions affects the catalytic performance of Li/MgO has now been explored. To analyze the structure and the stability of the samples, catalysts with well-defined stoichiometry were prepared using a co-precipitation method with freeze-drying and subsequent annealing. Gd and Fe were used as dopants. Apart from their potential direct role in catalysis, these dopants are anticipated to stabilize Li in the catalyst under the reaction conditions, allowing further clarification of the role of Li. In the case of Gd/Li co-doping, changes observed in EPR and 7Li-NMR spectra indicate the formation of correlated, next-neighbor Li−Mg⋅⋅⋅Gd+Mg pairs co-existing with 'isolated' Gd3+ ions at octahedral Mg lattice sites. For Li/Fe co-doping, no significant change in the EPR pattern is observed in the presence of Li+ ions, indicating a larger distance between the Li+ and Fe3+ cations in the MgO lattice. Hybrid DFT calculations explain the difference between Fe and Gd co-doping by a less efficient screening of the Coulomb repulsion between Gd3+ and neighboring cations in Gd doped samples, leading to the stabilization of LiMg near GdMg. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) screened hybrid density functional has been implemented using a NAO2GTO scheme to evaluate the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) with NAOs. ERI screening techniques allow the HSE functional calculations to be very efficient and scale linearly. The density matrix purification algorithms have been implemented, and the PSUTC2 and SUTC2 methods have been developed to deal with spin unrestricted systems with or without predetermined spin multiplicity, respectively. After the self-consistent field (SCF) process, additional O(N) post-SCF calculations for frontier molecular orbitals and maximally localized Wannier functions are also developed and implemented.
