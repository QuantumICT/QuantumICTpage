 abstract = {We present an efficient O(N) implementation of screened hybrid density functional for periodic systems with numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs). NAOs of valence electrons are fitted with gaussian-type orbitals, which is convenient for the calculation of electron repulsion integrals and the construction of Hartree-Fock exchange matrix elements. All other parts of Hamiltonian matrix elements are constructed directly with NAOs. The strict locality of NAOs is adopted as an efficient two-electron integral screening technique to speed up calculations.},
