The first-principles approach based on density-functional theory (DFT)/density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) is widely used in calculations of the systems' ground state energy, response properties (e.g., polarizability, phonon dispersions) and is playing an increasingly important role in chemistry, physics and materials science. For the large-scale calculations, the computation of the density matrix/response density matrix in DFT/DFPT has become the main performance bottleneck. One of the solutions is using the linear scaling method to get the density matrix and response density matrix. Here a massively parallel medium sparse matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm is designed for first-principle calculations and implemented on the new-generation Sunway supercomputer. Experiments show that the proposed method has obvious performance advantages compared to the original parallel version under moderate sparsity. The computing cores scale to 3,900,000 with strong scalability of 77.3%. Â© 1990-2012 IEEE.
