Since the interaction between electrons and atomic nuclei can affect the electronic structure, in recent years, first-principles-based electron-phonon renormalization methods have been applied in the condensed matter physics community to account for the influence of the electron-phonon coupling in solid systems. However, little is yet known about the behavior and trends of the electron-phonon renormalization in the molecules. In this work, the method for the electron-phonon renormalization in molecules has been derived, using which, we exhaustively investigate the zero-point renormalization in 32 molecules with three different density functions. We find that the renormalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap due to electron-vibration coupling does not relate to the atomic masses but quite relates to the electronic structure properties of the molecules.
