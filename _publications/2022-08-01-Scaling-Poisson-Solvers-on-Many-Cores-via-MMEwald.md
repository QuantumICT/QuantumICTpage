The Poisson solver for the calculation of the electrostatic potential is an essential primitive in quantum mechanics calculations. In this article, we adopt the Ewald method and propose a highly-optimized and scalable framework for Poisson solver, MMEwald, on the new generation Sunway supercomputer, capable of utilizing the collection of 390-core accelerators it uses. The MMEwald is based on a grid adapted cut-plane approach to partition the points into batches and distribute the batch to the processors. Furthermore, we propose a set of architecture-specific optimizations to efficiently utilize the memory bandwidth and computation capacity of the supercomputer. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the MMEwald in providing strong and weak scaling performance. Â© 1990-2012 IEEE.
