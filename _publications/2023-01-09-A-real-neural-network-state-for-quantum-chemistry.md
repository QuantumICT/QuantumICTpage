The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) has been successfully applied to solve the many-electron Schrödinger equation. In this work we propose a single-layer fully connected neural network adapted from RBM and apply it to study ab initio quantum chemistry problems. Our contribution is two-fold: 1) our neural network only uses real numbers to represent the real electronic wave function, while we obtain comparable precision to RBM for various prototypical molecules; 2) we show that the knowledge of the Hartree-Fock reference state can be used to systematically accelerate the convergence of the variational Monte Carlo algorithm as well as to increase the precision of the final energy. © 2023, CC BY.
