Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations have become an indispensable tool for investigating excited-state dynamics in solids. In this work, we propose a general framework, N2AMD, which employs an E(3)-equivariant deep neural Hamiltonian to boost the accuracy and efficiency of NAMD simulations. The preservation of Euclidean symmetry of Hamiltonian enables N2AMD to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Distinct from conventional machine learning methods that predict key quantities in NAMD, N2AMD computes these quantities directly with a deep neural Hamiltonian, ensuring supreme accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. Furthermore, N2AMD demonstrates excellent generalizability and enables seamless integration with advanced NAMD techniques and infrastructures. Taking several extensively investigated semiconductors as the prototypical system, we successfully simulate carrier recombination in both pristine and defective systems at large scales where conventional NAMD often significantly underestimates or even qualitatively incorrectly predicts lifetimes. This framework not only boosts the efficiency and precision of NAMD simulations but also opens new avenues to advance materials research. Â© 2024, CC BY-NC-SA.
