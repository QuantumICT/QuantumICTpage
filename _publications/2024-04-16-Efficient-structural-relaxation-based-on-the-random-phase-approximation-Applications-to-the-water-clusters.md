We report an improved implementation for evaluating the analytical gradients of the random phase approximation (RPA) electron-correlation energy based on atomic orbitals and the localized resolution of identity scheme. The more efficient RPA force calculations allow us to relax structures of medium-size water clusters. Particular attention is paid to the structures and energy orderings of the low-energy isomers of (H2O)n clusters with n = 21, 22, and 25. It is found that the energy ordering of the low-energy isomers of these water clusters are rather sensitive to how their structures are determined. For the five low-energy isomers of (H2O)25, the RPA energy ordering based on the RPA geometries is quite different from that based on the geometries relaxed by lower-level theories, in contrast with the situation of small water clusters like the water hexamer. The standard RPA underbinds the water clusters, and this underbinding behavior gets more pronounced as the complete basis set (CBS) limit is approached. The renormalized single excitation (rSE) correction remedies this underbinding, giving rise to a noticeable overbinding behavior at finite basis sets. However, as the CBS limit is approached, RPA+rSE yields an accuracy for the binding energies that is comparable to the best available double hybrid functionals, as demonstrated for the WATER27 testset.
