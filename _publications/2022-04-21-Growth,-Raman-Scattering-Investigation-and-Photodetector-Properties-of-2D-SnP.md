As an important metal phosphides material, 2D tin phosphides (SnPx 0 -1 are concluded to belong to A1g mode, which are consistent with the theoretical calculation results. Moreover, the field-effect transistor (FET) devices based on SnP nanosheets show a typical n-type characteristic with an on/off ratio of 103 at 200 K. SnP nanosheets also demonstrate excellent photoresponse performance under the illumination of 473, 532, and 639 nm lasers, which can be tuned by Vgs, Vds, and light power density. It is believed that these findings can provide the first-hand experimental information for the future study of 2D SnP nanosheets. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.
